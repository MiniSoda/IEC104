This is an implements of IEC-104 protocol which is commonly used in power plants'control&monitor systems.
As you can see in the source file, it's originally written by Ricardo L. Olsen, I modified it a lot with my experience during working in the electirc industry.
I'm not in area any more, and I found this classes is very helpful for people in the industry.
